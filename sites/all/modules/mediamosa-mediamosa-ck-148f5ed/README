INSTALL
-------

If you want to use this application, you need a Drupal 6 installation,
and you need a few modules too, like CCK and Embedded Mediafield module.

You can download them from:
- http://drupal.org/
- http://drupal.org/project/cck
- http://drupal.org/project/emfield
- http://drupal.org/project/views
- MediaMosa SDK (http://www.mediamosa.org/)
 
You can install this MediaMosa CK application, like other standard
Drupal 6 modules. You can choose which parts of this module install
depending on your wishes:
* Media: MediaMosa - This is our main module. If you turn it on, it will
install a basic version of MediaMosa CK.
* Mediamosa DC & QDC - This module provides the standard Dublin Core and
Qualified Dublin Core metadata fields.
* Mediamosa Frontend Statistics - You may want to see video usage
statistics, then this is your module.
* Mediamosa Video Content - This module provides the basic MediaMosa
node type.
* Mediamosa: asset browser - You can turn it on, if you want to see all
the videos in a nice View.
 
After the installation you can go to the global settings page:
admin/settings/media_mediamosa
Here you can decide, which services you want to use: still images,
transcode videos, access control. And here you can set the global
variables too: still parameters, transcode profiles.
 
On the node type configuration page you can configure your MediaMosa
field eg. video size, and node type related settings (still, transcode
and access parameters). You can set the video display format too. Like
full size video, video image linked to node etc.
 
After you set you MediaMosa CK you can start to create videos. Just
simply create a new MediaMosa node: node/add/mediamosa-videocontent,
fill the title, body, metadata fields, and attach a video, and press the
Save button. Then you node is saved, your still image and transcode jobs
are started. After a few seconds you will see your brand new video.
 
You can edit your videos too. If you go to the node edit page, you can
freely change your fields, or you can retanscode your video, or upload a
new one. Also you can limit the access of your video using domain and
realm access control.

Todo list:
----------
- Progress bar implementation.
- The asset, mediafile and the upload ticket generated just in that time,
  when the user click to the Attach button.

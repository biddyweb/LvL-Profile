The LvL profile comes with an install profile: a complete Drupal package containing the database and all files to get you started with MediaMosa LvL. 

Just upload the files to the root directory of your webserver.

Then follow the usual steps for installing Drupal (http://drupal.org/getting-started/install). 

When asked to choose a profile, select the "LvL MediaMosa" install profile 



The default username and password of the admin user is:

Username: LvL  
Password: lvl


Now just add your MediaMosa server information (server URL, server username and server password) here:
http://www.sitename.com/admin/mediamosa/config/connector/list

Click the "test" button, and you should now see a message:
"Normal call test successful, settings saved."


For each role, a demo user has been added. To use those accounts, just change the password of each account when logged in as admin.


You can change the test@test email adresses here:
http://www.sitename.com/user/1/edit
http://www.sitename.com/admin/build/contact/edit/1
http://www.sitename.com/admin/settings/site-information


Additional info: 

- You don't need to download Drupal from drupal.org separately since this
  profile already contains a complete Drupal 6.22 install
- You need to create a database for your website. (see http://drupal.org/getting-started/6/install/create-database)
- Does not accept database prefixes.
- Applied patches can be found in the "patches" directory (in the root, and in sites/all - both contain the same patch files)

http://drupal.org/project/demo_profile


The LvL profile comes with an install profile: a complete package containing all required files to get started with MediaMosa LvL. 

Just upload the files to the root directory of your webserver.

Then follow the usual steps for installing Drupal (http://drupal.org/getting-started/install). 

When asked to choose a profile, select the "LvL MediaMosa" install profile 



The default username and password of the admin user is:

Username: LvL  
Password: lvl

For each role, a demo user has been added. To use them, just change their password when logged in as the admin.



After login in as the administrator, you may have to change the file system paths:
admin/settings/file-system


You can change the test@test email adresses here:
www.sitename.com/user/1/edit
www.sitename.com/admin/build/contact/edit/1
www.sitename.com/admin/settings/site-information


Additional info: 

- You don't need to download Drupal from drupal.org separately since this
  profile already contains a complete Drupal 6.22 install
- You need to create a database for your website. (see http://drupal.org/getting-started/6/install/create-database)
- Does not accept database prefixes.
